            Genome
        short-hint : |
            TranSyT assings the reactions to the model based on the genome
    auto_accept_evalue:
        ui-name: |
            E-value threshold to automatically accept hits
        short-hint: |
            The value below which all hits are accepted as possible transporters
        long-hint: |
            Used in TranSyT's 'auto accept' method. This does not take the taxonomy of the BLAST hits into account,
            due to the high similarity with the query sequence. All reactions available in TranSyT’s internal database
            associated with TCDB entries that comply with the the specified conditions, will be assigned to the
            respective genes.
    percent_accept:
        ui-name: |
            Percentage top blast results acceptance
        short-hint: |
            Percentage of top blast results between thresholds that should be accepted for each query gene.
    limit_evalue_accept:
        ui-name: |
            E-value threshold lower threshold method-1
        short-hint: |
            The value above which all results should be disregarded by method-1.
        long-hint: |
            Used in TranSyT's 'auto accept' method. This does not take the taxonomy of the BLAST hits into account,
            due to the high similarity with the query sequence. All reactions available in TranSyT’s internal database

    <p>The Transport Systems Tracker (<i>TranSyT</i>) is a tool to identify transport systems and the compounds carried
    across membranes, based on the annotations of the Transporter Classification Database (TCDB). In addition, this
    tool also generates the respective transport reactions while providing the respective Gene-Protein-Reaction
    associations. In this version of the tool, it is possible to annotate a genome with Transport Classification (TC)
    numbers using information retrieved from <a href="http://www.tcdb.org/">TCDB</a>, a membrane transport proteins'
    database containing structural, functional, mechanistic, evolutionary and disease/medical information
    about transport systems.</p>

    <hr>

    <p><i>TranSyT</i> TC numbers annotation tool takes a genome as input. A set of parameters can also be defined by the
    user in order to change the stringency of the rules followed by the software. The effects of each parameter are
    described at the <em>Parameters</em> section below.</p>

    <p>KBase offers several ways to load genomes into a Narrative so that they can be used as one of the required
    inputs for this and other Apps:
       <ol>
         <li>Upload your own data from your local machine.</li>
         <li>Search for and add to the Narrative a genome from KBase&apos;s reference data collection.</li>
         <li>Use example data from the Data Browser slideout.</li>
         <li>Use a genome that you worked with in another Narrative or that another user has shared with you.</li>
       </ol>
    </p>

    <hr>

    <p><strong>Output Report</strong><br>Once the App finishes running, an output report is generated detailing the
    results. There, it is possible to observe the TC numbers that were assigned to the genome. If it is not the first time
    that the app is used for the same genome, only the new assignments will be displayed in the report. </p>

    <p><strong>Genome Object Viewer</strong><br>In addition to the <em>Output Report</em>, an <em>Object Viewer</em> is
     also generated displaying information about the TC numbers assigned to each gene on the <em>Ontology</em> column of the
     <em>Browse Features</em> tab.</p>
