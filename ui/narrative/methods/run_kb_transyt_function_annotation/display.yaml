    genome_id :
        ui-name : |
            Genome
        short-hint : |
            TranSyT assings the reactions to the model based on the genome
    auto_accept_evalue:
        ui-name: |
            E-value threshold to automatically accept hits
        short-hint: |
            The value below which all hits are accepted as possible transporters
        long-hint: |
            Used in TranSyT's 'auto accept' method. This does not take the taxonomy of the BLAST hits into account,
             due to the high similarity with the query sequence. All reactions available in TranSyT’s internal database
            associated with TCDB entries that comply with the the specified conditions, will be assigned to the
            respective genes.
    percent_accept:
        ui-name: |
            Percentage top blast results acceptance
        short-hint: |
            Percentage of top blast results that should be accepted
        long-hint: |
            Percentage of top blast results between thresholds that should be accepted for each query gene.
    limit_evalue_accept:
        ui-name: |
            E-value threshold lower threshold method-1
        short-hint: |
            The value above which all results should be disregarded by method-1.
        long-hint: |
            Used in TranSyT's 'auto accept' method. This does not take the taxonomy of the BLAST hits into account,
            due to the high similarity with the query sequence. All reactions available in TranSyT’s internal database
            associated with TCDB entries that comply with the the specified conditions, will be assigned to the

        ui-name: |
            Blast E-value threshold
        short-hint: |
            Blast E-value threshold
        long-hint: |
            Parameter '-evalue' of the NCBI Blast+ software
    bitscore_threshold:
        ui-name: |
            Blast bit score threshold
        short-hint: |
            Paramenter used to filter the results of the NCBI Blast+ software
    query_coverage_threshold:
        ui-name: |
            Blast minimum query coverage threshold
        short-hint: |
            Paramenter used to filter the results of the NCBI Blast+ software
    similarity_score:
        ui-name: |
            Blast similarity score
        short-hint: |
            Paramenter used to filter the results of the NCBI Blast+ software
    alpha_families:
        ui-name: |
            TC families annotation alpha value
        short-hint: |
            Paramenter used to balance the weight between frenquency and similarity scores

    <p>The Transport Systems Tracker (TranSyT) is a tool to identify transport systems and the compounds carried
    across membranes, based on the annotations of the Transporter Classification Database (TCDB). This version
    of the tool performs the annotation of the genes' possible TC numbers.</p>
